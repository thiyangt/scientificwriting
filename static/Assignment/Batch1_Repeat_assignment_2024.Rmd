**Assignment description:**

In this assignment, you are going to work on a dataset from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project in R organized by the R for Data Science community. It is a great way of improving your Data wrangling and visualization techniques, sharing and learning from others.

# TidyTuesday Data Repository

Every week since 2018, TidyTuesday moderators have provided a weekly challenge focused on the creation of data visualizations based around interesting, timely, or socially-important topics, such as those with data about the Womenâ€™s World Cup, incarceration trends, and school diversity in the United States. The official TidyTuesday data repository is available at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday (Scroll down on the page until you see DataSets) section.  Select any dataset from this repository for your assignment. Links to data repositories are given below.

# Task

Data is just a collection of numbers until you turn it into a story. Here you are trying to deliver the story through data visualization. Visualize data and create a report to tell an engaging story for your data analysis. 



i. Include suitable plots to uncover the stories, patterns in the data.

ii. Maximum number of plots to be included in the report is 6.

iii. Interpret the plots.

iv. Your report should be fully reproducible. You can use Quarto or Jupyter notebook to prepare your report.

v. Use Python to visualize data.

## Submission
