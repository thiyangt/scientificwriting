**Assignment description:**

In this assignment, you are going to work on a dataset from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project in R organized by the R for Data Science community. It is a great way of improving your Data wrangling and visualization techniques, sharing and learning from others.

# TidyTuesday Data Repository

Every week since 2018, TidyTuesday moderators have provided a weekly challenge focused on the creation of data visualizations based around interesting, timely, or socially-important topics, such as those with data about the Womenâ€™s World Cup, incarceration trends, and school diversity in the United States. The official TidyTuesday data repository is available at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday (Scroll down on the page until you see DataSets) section.  Select any dataset from this repository for your assignment. Links to data repositories are given below.
