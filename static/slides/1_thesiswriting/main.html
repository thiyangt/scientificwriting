"The VIX index represents the market’s estimate of the future volatility of the S&amp;P 500 over the next thirty
days. It provide a benchmark of the short-term expected volatility, as futures and options contracts can be
inscribed on (see Whaley, 2008). In fact, implied volatility reflects the market makers’ point of view about the
expected volatility of the futures’ underlying assets. Therefore, since market makers are often among the most
informed agents, implied volatility should outperform the historical one in forecasting the realized volatility
of the futures’ underlying asset (Shu and Zhang, 2012)."

.tiny["Despite the importance and the common use of VIX as a volatility measure, only little attention has been paid
to the problem of forecasting it. In particular, the few works on the subject show that the VIX is to some extent
predictable. This finding, albeit theoretically interesting, is not necessarily helpful for traders, because VIX is
tradable only as derivative contracts, whose dynamics does not always follow that of the VIX index. For
example, Asensio (2013), Degiannakis (2008), Kostantinidi et al. (2008), Konstantinidi and Skiadopoulos
(2011), who are among the few authors focusing on VIX futures (henceforth referred to as VXFs), highlight
only a weak evidence of statistical predictability and experience a low level of profitability when implementing
trading strategies based on VIX forecasts. The overall picture is not encouraging for investors: on the one hand,
there is evidence that VIX is predictable; on the other, it seems very hard to trade VXFs by learning from the

"**The overall goal of this research is to understand biogeographical and
environmental factors that may explain why Physaria ludoviciana is present** in some sand
prairies but absent from the biological composition in others. For this project, areas
where P. ludoviciana is growing will be compared to nearby or parallel areas where it is
absent from the community structure in three different states (IL, MN, and NE). **The
specific objectives are to compare:**

a) Plant species composition, and

b) Soil traits (texture, calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, potassium, boron, copper,
iron, sodium, phosphorus, sulfur, cation exchange capacity, organic matter, buffer pH and
soil pH). "

# Thematic 

- Reviews of literature are organized around a topic or issue, rather than the progression of time.

- Different aspects of the topic


---

# Methodological

- Compare the results that emerge from using different methods


---

# Chapter 3: Methodology

- Research design

- Sources of Data

- Sampling design 

- Statistical software

- Data analysis/ Statistical methods





---

# Chapter 4: Results

- Reporting results is not enough

- Establish the connections between the patterns that emerge from your analysis and your research questions

- Relate those connections to the existing research, theory and knowledge

# Data Visualization

---
# Cognitive Principles

**Less cognitive effort to read the chart (what is presented) and save the time to think about the content of the chart**

- Good visualizations take advantage of the human visual system's ability to process information with little effort. 

--

## Preattentive graph perception

It requires no conscious effort from the viewer to do understand what is presented through the design. It's automated and takes between 200-500 milliseconds to complete in the spatial memory.

--

(**Spatial** working **memory** entails the ability to keep spatial information active in working memory over a short period of time.)

---

# Preattentive visual properties

1. Color

2. Form: collinearity, curvature, marks, shape, size, spatial grouping, length, width, breadth

3. Spatial position: 2D, 3D

4. Movement: flicker, movement

<span>&lt;i class="fas  fa-leaf faa-flash animated "&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</span><span>&lt;i class="fas  fa-leaf faa-bounce animated "&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</span>



These are processed in our sensory memory without our conscious thoughts (without having knowledge of something).
